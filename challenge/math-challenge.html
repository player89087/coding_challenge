                <p> This project is created so that you have the possibility to look at some math stuff outside of school <br> 
                The design of the task is chosen in a way that you have to understand the task and then have to use some python<br>
                scripts to find the solution. Once you found a solution change the url and another problem will occur <br>
                In the next level you will always have the possibility to look at our solution of the problem beforehand. <br>
                We will provide further explaination for each problem to make sure you really unterstood it. <br>
                Make sure to sometimes check the html code of the website as it could contain some hints :).   </p>
                <p style="font-weight: bolder;">We will ask for the shortest solution solution possible.</p>
                <p style="color:red;">If your ready to challenge yourself and learn something new </p>
