   <p>This was the image you were presented. On it we can a see spiral and some rabbits <br>
    This should lead you to the so called Fibonacci Sequence which originates from mathematical problem <br>
    posed by Leonardo of Pisa (also known as Fibonacci) in his 1202 released book Liber Abaci <br>
    This book involves modeling the growth of an idealized rabbit popoulation under some specific assumptions <br>
    1. each single new born pair of rabbits (male,female) are put inside a field <br>
    2. rabbits are ready to mate at the age of 1 month -> end of second month -> female can produce another pair of rabbits <br>
    3. rabbits are immortal, will never stop mating, always create new pair consisting of male and female <br>
    So let's suppose the number of rabbits inside that cage at the end of the month is denoted by F<sub>n</sub>

    </div>
</p>

<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">F<sub>n</sub>=F<sub>n-1</sub>+F<sub>n-2</sub></h2>

<p style="color: blueviolet;"> F<sub>n-1</sub>: Last Month <br>
    F<sub>n-2</sub>: Two Months ago 
    This means that the amout of rabbits is calculated: Total this month = Total Last Mth + Two Mth ago </p>
    <p>
    So every new number of the Fibonacci Sequence shows how many pairs of rabbits exist after a given month. <br> <br>
    In the background of the picture you can see a spiral this correlates to the golden ratio. <br>
    The golden ratio is an irrational number, often symbolized by the greek letter φ (phi) and id approximately equal to 1.618 <br>
    It appears when a line is divided so that the ratio of the whole to the larger part is the same as the ratio of the <br>
    larger part to the smaller. This unique proportion is found throughout nature, art, and architecture, appearing <br>
    in the spirals of shells, sunflower seeds, and even in the design of famous structures like the Parthenon.<br>
    The golden ratio is also closely related to the Fibonacci sequence, where the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers <br>
    gradually approach φ.
