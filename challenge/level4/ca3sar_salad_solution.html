   <h1> Solution for level 3 - Caesar cipher frequency analysis </h1>

   <p>You were presented a picture of Asterix and Obelix the lone heroes against Caesar, or are they ? 
    Caesar used a cipher called, the caesar-cipher (how creative) he used to decrypt the messages he sent. 
    As seen in the picture below, the alphabet gets moved by a certain amount of characters, to make the message unreadable. 
    Example: <br>
    key: 3 <br>
    A -> D <br>
    B -> E <br>
    C -> F <br>
    <div><img src="caesar.png" width="750" height="400"></div>
    So the text will end up scrambled, however out of modern day view, this method of encryption is not safe anymore. 
    There are multiple possible ways to solve this level, first one being brute forcing the key until you get a text that makes sense 
    since there are only 26 possible keys, this would'nt take that long. 
    However there is another more, thought-through method than guessing with brute force. 
    </p>
    <p style="color: crimson; font-size: larger;">The so called Frequency Analysis</p>
    <p style="color: white;font-size: larger;">where you basically look at the distribution of the letters in the text and then compare them to the englisch language. <br>
    <p> As seen below this is the frequency of letters in the English language</p>
    <div>
    <img src="englisch_frequency.png" width="750" height="500">
    <br>
    <img src="frequency_text.png" width="750">
    </div>
    <p>If you search for the common letter you will see that is H, the distance in the alphabet between H and E is 
        3, this means the key is 3. Then apply caesar chiffre with the key to generate the following solution: 
    </p>

    <p style="color: white;font-size: larger;">Once you did that, you should be presented with the solution 
    this is level five of the challenge. at this point, simple tricks are no longer enough and you must 
    rely on careful analysis. pay attention to letter frequencies and common patterns in the language. 
     long ago, even caesar believed his messages were safe, but history proved otherwise. 
     like asterix and obelix outsmarting the roman empire, you just outsmarted us by either 
     brute forcing to receive the message, or by using frequency analysis to find the key. 
      congrats for finding the solution [ca3sar_salad.html]
