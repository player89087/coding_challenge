   <p>This was the image you were presented with. On it we can a see spiral and some rabbits 
    This should lead you, to the so called Fibonacci Sequence which originates from the mathematical problem
    posed by Leonardo of Pisa (also known as Fibonacci) in his 1202 released book "Liber Abaci" 
    This book involves modeling the growth of an idealized rabbit popoulation under some specific assumptions <br> <br>
    1. each single new born pair of rabbits (male and female) are put inside a field <br>
    2. rabbits are ready to mate at the age of 1 month -> end of the second month -> female can produce another pair of rabbits <br>
    3. rabbits are immortal, will never stop mating, always create new pair consisting of male and female <br>
    So let's suppose the number of rabbits inside that cage at the end of the month is denoted by F<sub>n</sub>

    </div>
</p>

<h2>F<sub>n</sub>=F<sub>n-1</sub>+F<sub>n-2</sub></h2>

<p3> F<sub>n-1</sub>: Last Month <br>
    F<sub>n-2</sub>: Two Months ago 
    amount of rabbits: Total this mth = Total Last Mth + Two Mth ago </p3>
    <p>
    So every new number of the Fibonacci Sequence represents, how many pairs of rabbits exist after a given month. <br> <br>
    In the background of the picture you can see a spiral this correlates to the golden ratio. How ever this was no part of the challenge, just nice to know :). 
    The golden ratio is an irrational number, often symbolized by the greek letter φ (phi) and is approximately equal to 1.618. 
    It appears when a line is divided so that the ratio of the whole to the larger part is the same as the ratio of the 
    larger part to the smaller. This unique proportion is found throughout nature, art, and architecture, appearing
    in the spirals of shells, sunflower seeds, and even in the design of famous structures like the Parthenon.
    The golden ratio is also closely related to the Fibonacci sequence, where the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers 
    gradually approach φ. Therefore look at some code <a href="https://github.com/player89087/Math_stuff/tree/main/fibonacci_sequence">here</a>
