                <p>  This project is designed to give you the opportunity to explore some math concepts beyond school. 
                The tasks are structured so that you first need to understand the problem, and then use Python scripts to find a solution. 
                Once you solve a problem, change the URL to reveal the next challenge.  In each level, you will have the option to view our solution beforehand. 
                We provide detailed explanations for every problem to ensure you fully understand it. 
                You can access the solution page by adding _solution to the current webpage URL (e.g., math-challenge_solution.html). 
                Make sure to occasionally check the HTML code of the website, as it may contain helpful hints. :) </p>
                <p style="font-weight: bolder;">Our goal is to challenge you to find the shortest solution possible.</p>
                <p style="color:red;">If your ready to challenge yourself and learn something new </p>
